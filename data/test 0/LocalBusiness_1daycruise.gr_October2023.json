The people working at the cruise ship were very helpful. The food was okay."},{"reviewbody":"4 out of 5 stars. Cruise is OK. It is not over crowded as others wrote, simply Everybody wants to sit outside,but there is not place for everyone. Lunch is great, Simple home food - chicken, fish, rise, salad. 2 cons - 1st loading and unloading of passengers take A LOT of time ( on each isladn) 2nd- there is no point to stop at Poros (2nd island) as you will have max 50 min time to visit it","datepublished":"Aug 1, 2023"},{"datepublished":"Aug 4, 2023","reviewbody":"It was nice, kind stuff, beautiful islands, good to get away from the city and enjoy the calmness the islands have.

You have blue sky above you,magnificent atmosphere.The temple of Aphaia is known for being the most beautiful temple in whole Greece. Visit it and make a lot of wonderful memories.","datepublished":"Jul 30, 2023"},{"datepublished":"Aug 2, 2023","reviewbody":"I visited the temple of Aphaia the day before leaving. It is one of the most beautiful temples I have ever visited. Nobody should miss this spot because it really is an exceptional site. The temple we see today (Doric) dates back to 490 BC. The columns are from local porous sandstone and it served as a model for the construction of the Parthenon and several other temples in Greece.The temple of Aphaia, the Acropolis and the Temple of Poseidon at Sounio form an isosceles triangle (the sacred triangle of antiquity).On the grounds of the Temple stands the Museum of Aphaia.It is the copy of goddess Athena and the votive tablet (560 BC) on which states clearly that the temple is dedicated to the goddess Aphaia.No tourist must leave the island of Aegina without visiting this very beautiful and significant Ancient Temple."},{"reviewbody":"If you are visiting the island of Aegina this temple is definitely worth the trip.The view from the top of the island is also great!","datepublished":"Jul 6, 2023"}],"page_url":"https:\/\/www.1daycruise.gr\/islands-we-visit\/la-isla-de-aegina\/"}
